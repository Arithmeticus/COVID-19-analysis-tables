## Special fork by Joel Kalvesmaki: tabular analyses

Tables of perhaps greatest interest, showing both absolute and proportionate numbers of reported cases, deaths, and recoveries from the Coronavirus COVID-19. All tables are sorted **initially** by number of **reported cases per million residents**:
* [Grouped by country](Country-Region.html)
* [Grouped by government type](government.html)
* [Grouped by religion](religion.html)
* [Grouped by landlocked or not](landlocked.html)

The reports are based on a hastily written XSLT stylesheet that groups the data from 
[Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) based on the data provided by 
[@samoyo](https://github.com/samayo/country-json), which appears to be based on data from 2019 or earlier. The table javascript comes from [the version of TableSorter provided by @mottie](https://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/).

I plan on refreshing the data only periodically, and only when I'm personally curious. You can fork or pull the project yourself and pull the files yourself, either from the master branch or the web-data one. You'll get the latest data working off the web-data branch, and being sure to pull from Hopkins's repo.
